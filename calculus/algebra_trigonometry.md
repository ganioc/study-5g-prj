## 2 实数系统的代数性质
equivalence laws,
closed under addition,
associative law, $(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)$
zero $0$, identity element for addition,
negative number, $a + (-a) = 0$, additive inverse
commutative law, $a+b=b+a$
closed under multiplication,
associative law, $(ab)c = a(bc)$
one $1$, identity element for multiplication,
reciprocal, multiplicative inverse of
$$
a\frac{1}{a}=1
$$
commutative law, $ab=ba$
The left distributive law, $a(b+c)=ab+ac$

field,
an important part of advanced modern algebra,
